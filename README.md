Over the last few years, e-commerce has become an indispensable part of the global retail framework. As more people choose to shop online, how and why, when and what makes a customer click on the “purchase” button is the question that many online retailers seek to answer. This project analyzes the online shoppers purchasing intention dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository and investigates what factors will classify a website visit as a visit with purchase made or without.

This dataset contains 12330 rows and 18 columns. The target variable is the last column of the dataset, which is the revenue column with Boolean values true or false. A true means the user made a purchase in this visit, and a false means the user did not make a purchase. The goal of project is to classify whether a user made a purchase or not given his/her information.
